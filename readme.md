# Smart Monkeys making smart funcitons

Initially made as a collection of useful functions by Arun, Pablo and Elia.
A fork was temporarily maintained by Arun Osborn before being merged back here for further development.

# Documentation

## Usage

In python, copy this to the top of your file:

```
#Imports
import sys


#APE library imports
sys.path.append("C:/Users/NAME/Doucments/GitHub/APEFunctions")
import APEFunctions


#Main body
```

# To do list

- Lowest Common Multiple (must work with the numbers in an array of any length)
- Highest Common Factor (must work with the numbers in an array of any length)
- Collatz Conjecture Sequencer (Sounds like an edgy si-fi band)FINISHED
- Try and improve IsPrime function if possible FINISHED
- Triangle Number Sequencer FINISHED
- FindPrimeFactors FINISHED
- Get FindPrimeFactors to work with a list of numbers
- Translation function between digits and words FINISHED
- Other sequencer functions
- Seperate functions into different files for different catagories FINISHED
- Numbers into words translation function FINISHED
- 2D/1D array display procedure (will print a well layed out grid) FINISHED
- 2D Graphical display for graphs
- Binary and decimal conversion (possibly works with any base)
- Delete ToDo.txt

# Notes

- A good number to test for primes is 9843498239573897
- IsPrime gets 9843498239573897 in 15.9 seconds... Or 12.49 on Pablo's laptop...
